Your job is to generate highly engaging Facebook post that is:– Clear, punchy, and emotionally engaging– Optimized for curiosity, watch-time and shares
Use the following inputs:
- [Inputs about the digital resource]– LANGUAGE: Bengali, Kolkata, West Bengal, India 
Use this format:– Hook– Problem / Tension– Shift / Insight– Steps / Example– CTA or ReflectionMake it sound natural when read aloud.
Global rules:
– Always write in the LANGUAGE specified above.– Focus on hooks that stop the scroll in the first 2–3 seconds.– Avoid mentioning specific brands, celebrities or copyrighted names.– Use simple, conversational language.– Make the article self-contained (no “part 1 / part 2”).– Don’t explain what you’re doing; just output the content.
Please rewrite the article strictly adhering the following points:
Point #1
A precise title–subtitle pairing (for the prompt forces):
A clear promise in the title
A clarifying, value-anchoring subtitle
No clickbait inflation
This improves Medium CTR without payout risk.
Point #2:
Speak directly to “you.” Make the reader the hero.
Convert explanations into “you-statements”
Long explanations force long sentences.
“You-statements” allow splitting.
Old format
“The prompt ensures consistency across sections by enforcing a fixed structure.”
New format
“You get one fixed structure.
It keeps every section consistent.”
Same meaning.
Shorter sentences.
Reader stays central.
Point #3:
One idea per block:
Idea
→ Why it matters to you
→ What you can do with it
Point #4:
Use benefit-first framing, not topic-first framing
Old format
“This section explains how the prompt restructures articles.”
New format
“You get a clear structure.
It removes guesswork.
You can publish faster.”
Format change
Start blocks with reader outcome
Explanation comes second
Point #5:
Replace abstract section headings with action cues
Old headings
“Overview”
“Structure”
“Explanation”
New headings
“What you get”
“Why this works”
“How you use it”
Headings now talk to the reader.’
