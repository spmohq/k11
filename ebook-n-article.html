      <div class="prompt-card">
        <h2>Prompt #2: Medium Article Strategist</h2>
        <pre id="p2" class="prompt-text">You are required to help me write an medium.com article book based on the uploaded document. First, read and fully understand the document. Then, provide the most suitable details for the proposed article by following the given structures as examples. The examples are for structural reference only—do not reuse or replicate their text unless it is directly relevant to the proposed article details derived from the uploaded document.

Examples:

1. The "Future of Wealth" Vision 
"Write a visionary closing article titled 'The Era of the Software Creator'. 
● The Vision: Paint a picture of a future where anyone with an idea can build it instantly. 
● The Separation: Wealth will no longer belong to those who can type code, but to those who have the best ideas and taste. 
● Inspiration: End with a powerful statement: 'The only limit is your imagination, not your technical skills.' 
● Final CTA: Encourage them to start their journey today.

2. The "Internal Tool" Efficiency Hack 
"Write a case study style article about how a business owner saved 20 hours a week by Vibe Coding an internal tool. 
● The Story: A fictional business owner (e.g., Sarah, who runs an agency). 
● The Pain: She was manually copying data from emails to Excel. 
● The Fix: She used AI to write a simple script to automate it. It took her 30 minutes to generate. 
● The Lesson: You don't need to sell software to make money from Vibe Coding; you can use it to save massive amounts of time (which is money)." 

3. The "No-Code vs. Vibe Coding" Showdown 
"Write a comparison article: 'Why Vibe Coding is Better Than No-Code Tools (Bubble/Webflow)'. 
● The Argument: No-Code tools have steep learning curves and 'platform lock-in'. 
● The Vibe Advantage: With Vibe Coding, you own the actual code. You can host it anywhere. It's cheaper. 
● Analogy: Compare No-Code to renting a house vs. Vibe Coding to building your own house with magic robots. 
● Conclusion: Why Vibe Coding is the superior long-term play for money makers."

4. The "Prompting Logic" Masterclass 
"Write an educational article on 'How to Talk to AI So It Writes Perfect Code'. 
● The Concept: Explain that Vibe Coding is about requirements gathering, not coding. 
● The Tip: Teach the 'Rubber Duck' method—explaining the app step-by-step in plain English before asking for code. 
● Example: Show a 'Bad Prompt' (vague) vs. a 'Good Prompt' (specific logic). 
● Goal: Teach the reader that their clarity of thought is their new programming language."

5. The "Freelancer's Secret Weapon" 
"Write an article for freelancers titled 'How to 10x Your Rates by Becoming a Vibe Coder'. 
● The Problem: Clients don't pay for code; they pay for solutions. 
● The Pivot: Explain how a writer or marketer can now say 'Yes' to technical projects (like building a simple landing page or calculator) by using Vibe Coding. 
● Benefit: They capture more of the client's budget without hiring a developer. 
● Tone: Strategic and profitable."  

6. The "What is Vibe Coding?" Explainer 
"Act as a Tech Trend Analyst. Write an introductory article titled 'Vibe Coding: How to Build Software Without Knowing How to Code'. 
● The Hook: Start by explaining that the barrier to entry for building apps has collapsed. 
● Definition: Define 'Vibe Coding' simply: It's about writing instructions in plain English, not writing syntax in code. 
● The Opportunity: Explain why this is the biggest wealth creation opportunity for non-technical people in 2025. 
● Tone: Exciting and empowering." 

7. The "Recession-Proof" Guide 
"Write an article titled 'How to Recession-Proof Your Income in [INSERT YEAR]'. 
● Strategy: List 4 skills that are always in demand, regardless of the economy. 
● Advice: Tips on building an emergency fund quickly. 
● Tone: Calm and rational, avoiding fear-mongering. 
● Closing: A quote about opportunity in times of crisis." 

8. The "Passive Income" Tier List 
"Write an article ranking Passive Income ideas by barrier to entry. 
● Tier 1: $0 to start (e.g., digital products). 
● Tier 2: $$ to start (e.g., dividend stocks). 
● Tier 3: $$$$ to start (e.g., real estate). 
● Reality Check: For each tier, write one sentence in italics explaining the hard truth or risk involved." 

9. The "Contra-arian" View 
"Everyone says [INSERT POPULAR OPINION], but I want you to argue the opposite. Write an article explaining why [INSERT OPPOSITE OPINION] is actually better for beginners. 
● Logic: Use analogies to explain your point. 
● Tone: Friendly but firm. You are letting the reader in on a secret. 
● Conclusion: Encourage the reader to think for themselves." 

10. The "Mistakes to Avoid" (Fear Angle) 
"Write a warning-style article titled 'The Top 5 Mistakes People Make When [INSERT ACTION]'. 
● Empathy: Start by acknowledging that [INSERT ACTION] is hard. 
● Body: List the 5 mistakes. For each one, explain why it kills progress and how to fix it. 
● Emphasis: Use Bold Caps for the name of each mistake. 
● Call to Action: End by asking the reader which mistake they are guilty of."

11. The "Myth Buster" 
"Act as an industry expert in [INSERT NICHE]. Write an article that debunks a common myth about [INSERT TOPIC]. 
● Hook: Start with a controversial statement that grabs attention immediately. 
● Structure: Provide 3 clear reasons why this myth is wrong. Use Bold text for the main argument in each section. 
● Tone: Authoritative, direct, and slightly provocative. 
● Ending: Conclude with one actionable step the reader can take today to do it the right way."</pre>
