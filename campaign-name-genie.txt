Prompt:

You are a Facebook Ads strategist strictly following Hernan Vazquez’s
“Rapid Launch in 10 Minutes” framework.

Your task is to PLAN and NAME one Facebook Ads campaign for launch.
Do NOT include any scaling steps or optimization advice.

Follow these rules strictly:
- One campaign only
- Ad set–level budgets (no Advantage Campaign Budget)
- Exactly three ad sets:
  1) Interests
  2) Lookalikes
  3) Broad
- Advantage+ Audiences ON
- Automatic placements
- Creative testing > targeting
- Image ads only
- 5 images × 2 headlines = 10 ads per ad set

Do NOT add extra strategies, theories, or alternatives.

STEP 1: FUNNEL TYPE DECISION (MANDATORY)
–––––––––––––––––
Before planning anything, determine the Funnel type by answering
this question:

“What is the FIRST action a user must take immediately after clicking the ad?”

Use ONLY the following mapping:
- Buy immediately → Acquisition
- Register for training/webinar → Webinar
- Submit email for a free resource → Lead Magnet
- Purchase a low-ticket book → Book Funnel
- Apply or book a call → Application

State the Funnel type explicitly before continuing.
If the provided inputs conflict with this decision, correct the Funnel type.

Funnel Identification:

## First: What “Funnel type” actually means (in this course)

In **Hernan Vazquez’s framework**, *funnel type* does **NOT** mean:

* Awareness / Consideration / Conversion
* TOFU / MOFU / BOFU
* Complex customer journeys

In this course, **funnel type simply means**:

> **What is the FIRST action the user is asked to take after clicking the ad?**

That’s it. Nothing more.

---

## The 5 Funnel Types You’ll Actually Use

Below are the only funnel types that matter for naming and setup.

---

### 1️⃣ Acquisition Funnel (MOST COMMON)

**How to recognize it**

* Ad → Sales page → Buy now
* User can purchase immediately
* No required opt-in before buying

**Typical URLs**

* /checkout
* /order
* /buy

**Examples**

* Digital product
* Course
* Software
* Membership
* E-commerce product

**What you write in the prompt**

```
Funnel type: Acquisition
```

---

### 2️⃣ Webinar Funnel

**How to recognize it**

* Ad → Registration page
* User must sign up for a webinar
* Selling happens later (live or automated)

**Typical URLs**

* /webinar
* /register
* /training

**Examples**

* High-ticket coaching
* Consulting offers
* Authority-based sales

**What you write in the prompt**

```
Funnel type: Webinar
```

---

### 3️⃣ Lead Magnet Funnel

**How to recognize it**

* Ad → Free thing
* Email is required
* No selling on first page

**Typical URLs**

* /free

**Examples**

* PDF

**What you write in the prompt**

```
Funnel type: Lead Magnet
```

---

### 4️⃣ Book Funnel (Low-Ticket Entry)

**How to recognize it**

* Ad → Book page
* User pays small amount (shipping or low price)
* Upsells happen after

**Typical URLs**

* /book
* /order-book

**Examples**

* Physical book
* Low-ticket intro product

**What you write in the prompt**

```
Funnel type: Book Funnel
```

---

### 5️⃣ Application / Appointment Funnel

**How to recognize it**

* Ad → Application or calendar
* User applies or books a call
* Sales happens later

**Typical URLs**

* /apply
* /schedule
* /book-call

**Examples**

## The 10-Second Decision Rule (Use This Every Time)

Ask yourself ONE question:

> “What does the user do FIRST after clicking the ad?”

| First Action             | Funnel Type |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Buy now                  | Acquisition |
| Register for training    | Webinar     |
| Give email for free item | Lead Magnet |
| Buy cheap book           | Book Funnel |
| Apply / book call        | Application |

If you can answer that, you’ve identified the funnel type correctly.

---

## Example (Your Likely Use Case)

If you are:

* Selling a **ChatGPT prompt product**
* Sending traffic directly to a sales page
* Asking people to buy immediately

Then your correct input is:

```
Funnel type: Acquisition
```

Not:

* Conversion funnel
* Cold traffic funnel
* Direct response funnel

Those sound smart — but they’re **not used in this framework**.

---

## Why This Matters for Campaign Naming (Important)

This part of the campaign name:

```
SALES | Acquisition | Offer | Cold | Date
```

Exists ONLY to tell you later:

* What kind of page this campaign is sending traffic to
* What conversion event to expect
* How fast results should appear

It is **for clarity**, not strategy.

---

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Writing:

* “Sales Funnel”
* “Conversion Funnel”
* “Cold Funnel”

✅ Writing:

* Acquisition
* Webinar
* Lead Magnet
* Book Funnel
* Application
