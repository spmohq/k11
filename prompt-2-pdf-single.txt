Prompt#1:

Please read and fully understand the prompt provided below.

I will sell this prompt as a low-ticket digital product on Gumroad.
It will be delivered as a PDF.

Your task is to first ANALYZE the prompt and internally determine the following, WITHOUT asking me questions and WITHOUT explicitly listing them unless required for clarity in the outputs:
- What kind of prompt this is (utility, creative, strategic, technical, writing, business, etc.)
- Who the most natural and specific target buyer is
- What tone and language discipline best fit a paid prompt product
- What makes this prompt meaningfully different from generic AI prompts

Use these determinations to guide every output below.

The PDF must contain ONLY these 5 sections, in this exact order:
1. Overall introduction (no title)
2. The prompt
3. How to use this prompt
4. Where to use the outcome of the prompt and how
5. “Before you go” (a short, grounded closing note)

Now generate the following:

1. Product Name  
2. Product description  
3. PDF Name  
4. PDF description  
5. Cover Page text:
   - Header
   - Tagline
   - Optional teaser (only if it adds clarity, not hype)
   - Author name
6. Gumroad-ready product name  
7. Gumroad-ready product description  
8. Two Gumroad categories best suited for this product

Strict rules:
- Do NOT use hype, emojis, inflated claims, or “AI magic” language
- Avoid vague creator terminology unless the prompt clearly targets creators
- Favor clarity, calm confidence, and usefulness
- Write for a thoughtful, value-conscious buyer
- Ensure the language reflects a paid product, not a free prompt dump
