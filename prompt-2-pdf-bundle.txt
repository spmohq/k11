Prompt#1:

Please read and fully understand the prompt content provided below.

I will sell this as a low-ticket digital product on Gumroad.
It will be delivered as a PDF.

The product may contain:
- A single prompt, OR
- Multiple related prompts forming a small bundle or system

Your first step is to analyze the provided prompt content and internally determine:
- Whether this is best treated as a single prompt or a bundle
- If a bundle, what unifying theme or capability connects the prompts
- The most natural product framing (tool, system, kit, framework, bundle, etc.)
- The most specific and appropriate target buyer
- The correct tone and language discipline for a paid prompt product
- What differentiates this product from generic prompt bundles

Do NOT ask me questions.
Do NOT expose this analysis unless it naturally improves clarity.

The PDF must contain ONLY these 5 sections, in this exact order:
1. Overall introduction (no title)
2. The prompt or prompts
3. How to use this prompt or bundle
4. Where to use the outcome of the prompt(s) and how
5. “Before you go” (short, grounded closing note)

Now generate the following:

1. Product Name  
2. Product description  
3. PDF Name  
4. PDF description  
5. Cover Page text:
   - Header
   - Tagline
   - Optional teaser (only if it adds clarity, not hype)
   - Author name
6. Gumroad-ready product name  
7. Gumroad-ready product description  
8. Two Gumroad categories best suited for this product

Strict rules:
- No hype, emojis, inflated promises, or “AI magic” language
- Never describe this as a “collection of prompts” unless necessary
- Emphasize outcomes, use-cases, and clarity over quantity
- Write for a thoughtful, value-conscious buyer
- Language must feel intentionally designed, not auto-generated

Here is the prompt content:

Prompt Name(s): [Prompt Name or Names]  
Prompt Description(s): [Prompt Description(s)]  
Prompt(s): [Prompt or Prompts]


Follow-up Prompt#1:

Using the product framing, positioning, and bundle logic already established in the previous step, write the COMPLETE content of the PDF.

Do NOT re-evaluate positioning or audience.
Assume those decisions are locked.

The PDF must contain ONLY the following five sections, in this exact order, with no section titles:

1. Overall introduction  
- Calm, grounded, and outcome-oriented  
- Explain what this tool or bundle helps the reader do  
- Set realistic expectations  

2. The prompt or prompts  
- Present the prompt(s) cleanly and clearly  
- If this is a bundle, separate prompts cleanly without over-explaining  
- Do not add commentary inside the prompt text  

3. How to use this prompt or bundle  
- Step-by-step usage  
- Practical, minimal, and non-technical  
- Include guidance for adapting outputs  

4. Where to use the outcome of the prompt(s) and how  
- Specific usage contexts  
- Explain how to apply, not just where  

5. “Before you go”  
- Short closing note  
- Reassuring, grounded, non-marketing  

Strict rules:
- No hype, no emojis, no inflated promises  
- No references to Gumroad, pricing, or selling  
- Language must feel intentional and paid, not verbose  
- Avoid generic AI advice  

Write clean, readable paragraphs.
Short sentences. Short sections.

Now write the complete PDF content.

We are writing the PDF content for this prompt product.
All positioning, audience, tone, and bundle decisions are already locked.

Rules:
- Do not reference other sections
